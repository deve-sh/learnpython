## Contribution

The tutorials aren't the best and certainly need a lot of improvement. This project started out as just another normal place to try out my web designing skills. But I want it to be more useful than just that.

You can provide feedback on the project by [filling this form](https://goo.gl/forms/OyPalEe03RCoNufu2) which will greatly help me.

**Instructions Contribute to the code itself.**

The JavaScript aspects are present in the scripts directory and the CSS Files are present in the styles directory. The pages are in the root directory itself. Just clone the repository to your system using your terminal / bash.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deve-sh/learnpython.git
cd learnpython
```

Make the changes that you deem appropriate and start a pull request, past checking if the changes are appropriate I will merge the changes to the master directory.

### Further

**Note** : Sorry for the poor code, it was at a time I was starting out with stuff and I myself found it tough to refactor stuff. More precisely, at places where the `<pre>` tag might have done the job and a syntax highlighting library would have sufficed, I didn't use it at that time, so yeah, those are root problems I aim to remove by the end of this year and publish a more full version of it.
