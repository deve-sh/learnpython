We have learnt almost half of what one needs to know in Python to begin well.
<bR>
<BR>
Now, just imagine a scenario; you are working on a program that requires 20 numbers everytime for its execution. Would you write a line of code for input of every single variable? No. Obviously, no one has that much time on their hand.
<br>
<Br>
Here loops come into use. Loops repeat a single line of code every singe time.
<br>
<br>
There are two main types of loops in Python :
<ul>
	<li>While Loop</li>
	<li>For Loop</li>
</ul>
Loops are also called <b>Iteration Statements</b>.
<br>
<Br>
There are also <b>Range function</b> and <b>Break Statement</b> that comes into play in looping.
<br>
<br>
Let's get started.
</div>
<div id="code">
	>> <span class="one">for </span> x in <span class="one">range</span>(0,10):<Br>
	 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <span class="print">print</span> x
</div>
<div id="card">
Here let's see what everything does. The <b>for</b> loop actually iterates over a statement everytime. Here range function works by increasing the value of the variable <b>x</b> from 0 by 1 till 10 (Not euql to 10) one by one.
<Br>
<BR>
And hence the print will be something like this : <Br>
</div>
<div id="code">
0<br>
1<br>
2<br>
3<br>
4<br>
5<br>
6<br>
7<br>
8<br>
9<br>
</div>
<div id="card">
	This is the function of the range function, we will have a better look at for loops in the upcoming tutorial.
	<Br>
	<h2 style="color: #999999"> While Loops </h2>
	While loop continues on as long as a condition is met.
	<br>
</div>
<div id="code">
>> <span class="one">while </span> (1 < 2):<BR>
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <span class="print">print</span> "This will never stop! This is an infinite loop as 1 < 2 is always true!"
</div>
<div id="card">
In this example, the condition 1 < 2 is always true hence the loop will go on forever.
<br>
<h2 style="color: #999999">More on the range function</h2>
The range function can do more things. Here take a snippet.<br>
</div>
<div id="code">
	>> <span class="one">for </span> x in <span class="one">range</span>(0,10,2):<Br>
	 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <span class="print">print</span> x<Br><Br>
0<br>
2<br>
4<br>
6<br>
8<br>
</div>
<div id="card">
	In the above example, the last point in the range function is important. The <b>2</b> signifies that the value of x with increase by 2 every time. And hence, the values of x will be printed as 0,2,4,6,8 (Not 10; as 10 will be out of the range).
	<Br>
	<h2 style="color: #999999">Break Statement</h2>
	This is an important statement, also called an exit statement. In loops once would like to break a loop once a condition is met.
