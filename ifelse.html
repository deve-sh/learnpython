    Sometimes in a code, one likes to do things based on conditions. One such profound example is, say in a program to check which of the two numbers are greater. We compare two numbers and print which one is bigger.<br/><br/>
    This is called a conditional operation, and it is done using <b>if, else</b>, and <b>elif (Short for <u>else-if</u>)</b> statements, which form the basics of coding methodoligy).
    <br/><br/>
    Take for example this code snippet :
  </div>
  <div id="code">
    <br/>
    >> if(<span class="one">5</span> < <span class="one">7</span>):<br/>
     &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span class="print">print</span> "This will always come"
    <br/>
    >> else:<br/>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span class="print">print</span> "This will never come"
  </div>
  <div id="card">
    As in the example above. The condition inside the if-else statements are enclosed in brackets and the part to be executed has to be indented using a '<b>:</b>' properly. This goes for every piece of code in Python.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Note</b> : If in the program one of the conditions is met, then the other condition is not taken care of. Keep this in mind as it is really important and a topic of great confusion for beginner coders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another code snippet is as follows :
    <br/> 
  </div>
  <div id="code">
    >> <span class="one">x</span> = input("Enter the first number")<br/><br/>
    >> <span class="one">y</span> = input("Enter the second number")<br/><br/>
    >> if(<span class="one">x</span> == <span class="one">y</span>): &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <span class="comment"># The == operator is used to compare quality between two 'operands'</span>
    <br/>
     &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span class="print">print</span> "The two are equal."
    <br/>
    >> else:<br/>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span class="print">print</span> "The two are unequal."
  </div>
  <div id="card">
    <h2 style="color: #999999">The Elif Statement</h2>
    Life is already restricting enough, the last thing you would actually want is coding not giving you enough options. Well, there is no lack of coding options.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even in the conditionals in python, you can have as many conditions as you want, using the <b>elif</b> statement.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Take for example this code snippet and learn it the final way for this page :
  </div>
  <div id="code">
    >> <span class="one">x</span> = input("Enter the first number")<br/><br/>
    >> <span class="one">y</span> = input("Enter the second number")<br/><br/>
    >> if(<span class="one">x</span> == <span class="one">y</span>):
    <br/>
     &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span class="print">print</span> "The two are equal."
    <br/><br/>
    >> elif(<span class="one">x</span> > <span class="one">y</span>):<br/>
     &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span class="print">print</span> (x," is greater")
     <br/><br/>
    >> elif(<span class="one">x</span> < <span class="one">y</span>):<br/>
     &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span class="print">print</span> (x," is greater")
     <br/><br/>
    >> else:<br/>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span class="print">print</span> "This will never show!"
  </div>
  <div id="card">
    Take a moment as to why the last statement will never work!

    If you figure it out, congrats, not a big deal. Go ahead with the next tutorial.

    If you don't, no problem. Still go ahead, you will smile when you eventually figure it out.
